This means that the area surrounding the substation can experience a significant ground potential rise, which can extend hundreds of meters beyond the grounding conductors. This phenomenon is crucial to understanding how safety should be managed around substation external fencing.</p>\n<h2>Touch Potential: What You Need to Know</h2>\n<p>External fencing, often referred to as perimeter fencing or property fencing, can present a significant touch potential. When touching the fence, the potential difference between the metal part of the fence and the ground can cause risks. According to NBR 15751, it is essential to evaluate the potential for touch considering the situation in which a person touches the fence while standing 1 meter away from a grounding point.<br><br>If the fence is grounded at multiple points, a varied potential for touch may arise along the fence due to a short circuit. To ensure safety, the highest possible potential for touch between the grounding points must be considered.</p>\n<h2><figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://TheEnergyWhisperer.github.io/media/posts/5/1724018663446.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1061\" height=\"1500\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://TheEnergyWhisperer.github.io/media/posts/5/responsive/1724018663446-xs.png 640w ,https://TheEnergyWhisperer.github.io/media/posts/5/responsive/1724018663446-sm.png 768w ,https://TheEnergyWhisperer.github.io/media/posts/5/responsive/1724018663446-md.png 1024w ,https://TheEnergyWhisperer.github.io/media/posts/5/responsive/1724018663446-lg.png 1366w ,https://TheEnergyWhisperer.github.io/media/posts/5/responsive/1724018663446-xl.png 1600w ,https://TheEnergyWhisperer.github.io/media/posts/5/responsive/1724018663446-2xl.png 1920w\"></figure>Importance of Compliance and Preventative Measures</h2>\n<p>Ensuring that external fences are properly grounded and that the touch potential is properly assessed is crucial to the safety of any electrical installation. Following standards and recommended practices, such as those established in NBR 15751, helps prevent accidents and protect both workers and the general public.<br><br>Safety in electrical installations is an aspect that should not be neglected. Understanding and correctly applying grounding standards and touch potential assessment are essential to maintaining a safe and regulatory-compliant environment.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Maintaining safety on the external fences of substations is vital to the protection of everyone involved. Adopting best practices and following established standards ensures not only compliance, but also operational safety.

However, the keraunic index has limitations, as it does not reflect the amount of cloud-to-ground lightning, the most relevant parameter for sizing lightning protection systems.<br><br>Currently, there are more accurate methods for characterizing lightning strikes. These methods use advanced systems that, in addition to counting the lightning that hits the ground, identify other important parameters, such as the time and location of the impact, the intensity and polarity of the main discharge, the number and intensity of subsequent discharges, and the waveforms. These systems employ a wide range of technologies, from simple spark gaps and magnetic recorders installed on tall structures to sophisticated equipment for monitoring electric and magnetic fields.<br><br>The density of atmospheric discharges to the earth (Ng = atmospheric discharges/km¬≤/year) defines the annual number of discharges that occur in a given region. The probability of a structure being struck by lightning in a year is calculated by multiplying the discharge density by the size of the exposed area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe structure.<br><br>Annex F of the NBR-5419 standard provides maps of the Density of Atmospheric Discharges (Ng) for Brazil and its regions. These maps were prepared based on records of light pulses captured by the Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) on board NASA's Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite, during the period from 1998 to 2009. This same map is made available by the ONS for studies of basic design of lines and substations.<br><br>The correlation between the keraunic index (Td) and the discharge density (Ng) can be established by empirical formulas specific to each region, based on statistical surveys. According to NBR-5419, for temperate regions, the relationship between Ng and Td is approximately Ng ‚âà 0.1 Td.</p>\n<p>#AtmosphericDischarges #LightningSafety #DischargeProtection #StandardNBR5419 #MeteorologicalAnalysis<br>#MonitoringTechnology #ProtectionSystems #LightningAndDischarges<br>#RiskManagement #ElectricalEngineering #AtmosphericSciences #DischargeMaps #LightningMonitoring #StructureSafety<br>#MeteorologicalData</p>",
